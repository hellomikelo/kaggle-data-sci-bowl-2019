    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this dataset, you are provided with game analytics for the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. In this app, children navigate a map and complete various levels, which may be activities, video clips, games, or assessments. Each assessment is designed to test a child's comprehension of a certain set of measurement-related skills. There are five assessments: Bird Measurer, Cart Balancer, Cauldron Filler, Chest Sorter, and Mushroom Sorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of the competition is to use the gameplay data to forecast how many attempts a child will take to pass a given assessment (an incorrect answer is counted as an attempt). Each application install is represented by an `installation_id`. This will typically correspond to one child, but you should expect noise from issues such as shared devices. In the training set, you are provided the full history of gameplay data. In the test set, we have truncated the history after the start event of a single assessment, chosen randomly, for which you must predict the number of attempts. Note that the training set contains many `installation_ids` which never took assessments, whereas every `installation_id` in the test set made an attempt on at least one assessment.\n",

    "\n",
    "These are the main data files which contain the gameplay events.  \n",
    "`event_id` - Randomly generated unique identifier for the event type. Maps to event_id column in specs table.  \n",
    "`game_session` - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping events within a single game or video play session.  \n",
    "`timestamp` - Client-generated datetime  \n",
    "`event_data` - Semi-structured JSON formatted string containing the events parameters. Default fields are: event_count, event_code, and game_time; otherwise fields are determined by the event type.  \n",
    "`installation_id` - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping game sessions within a single installed application instance.  \n",
    "`event_count` - Incremental counter of events within a game session (offset at 1). _Extracted from event_data_.  \n",
    "`event_code` - Identifier of the event 'class'. Unique per game, but may be duplicated across games. E.g. event code '2000' always identifies the 'Start Game' event for all games. _Extracted from event_data_.  \n",
    "`game_time` - Time in milliseconds since the start of the game session. _Extracted from event_data_.  \n",
    "`title` - Title of the game or video.  \n",
    "`type` - Media type of the game or video. Possible values are: __Game__, __Assessment__, __Activity__, __Clip__.  \n",
    "`world` - The section of the application the game or video belongs to. Helpful to identify the educational curriculum goals of the media. Possible values are: __NONE__ (at the app's start screen), __TREETOPCITY__ (Length/Height), __MAGMAPEAK__ (Capacity/Displacement), __CRYSTALCAVES__ (Weight).  \n",

    "`info` - Description of the event.  \n",
    "`args` - JSON formatted string of event arguments. Each argument contains:  \n",
    "`name` - Argument name.  \n",
    "`type` - Type of the argument (string, int, number, object, array).  \n",
    "`info` - Description of the argument.  \n",
